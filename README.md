# Indian Agriculture Sector Analysis - Power BI Dashboard  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing the Indian agriculture sector.  
It visualizes key insights such as state-wise crop production, seasonal patterns, and land usage.  
The dashboard helps policymakers, researchers, and farmers make data-driven decisions.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement  
Agriculture is vital to Indiaâ€™s economy, but crop production varies widely across states and seasons.  
Lack of clear insights into trends and patterns makes resource planning difficult.  
This dashboard solves the problem by providing a centralized, visual analysis of agricultural data.  

## ðŸ‘¥ End Users  
- Government agencies & policymakers  
- Researchers & analysts  
- Farmers & cooperatives  
- Agribusiness companies  
- Educational institutions  

## ðŸ›  Technology Used  
- **Power BI Desktop**: For data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation.  

## ðŸ“Š Features  
- State-wise and district-wise crop production analysis  
- Seasonal crop trends  
- Area vs. production visualization  
- Interactive filters for year, crop, and region

## ðŸš€ How to Use  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**.  
3. Explore the dashboard with available filters.  

## ðŸ“‚ Data Information  
The dataset used in this project was provided in raw form and contained inconsistencies.  
All **data cleaning and transformation** (such as handling missing values, formatting, and filtering)  
were performed inside **Power BI Power Query Editor**.  

Hence, the repository includes:  
- `raw_data.csv` â†’ Original dataset provided  
- `Indian_Agriculture.pbix` â†’ Contains all the cleaning steps and transformations applied  

If needed, the cleaned data can be exported directly from the `.pbix` file.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope  
- Integration with real-time agriculture data APIs  
- AI/ML-based crop yield predictions  
- Automated reports for farmers and policymakers
