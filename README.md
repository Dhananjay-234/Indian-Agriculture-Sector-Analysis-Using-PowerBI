# Indian Agriculture Sector Analysis - Power BI Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing the Indian agriculture sector.  
It visualizes key insights such as state-wise crop production, seasonal patterns, and land usage.  
The dashboard helps policymakers, researchers, and farmers make data-driven decisions.  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Agriculture is vital to India’s economy, but crop production varies widely across states and seasons.  
Lack of clear insights into trends and patterns makes resource planning difficult.  
This dashboard solves the problem by providing a centralized, visual analysis of agricultural data.
